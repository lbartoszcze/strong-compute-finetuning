    "\n",
    "Can we negate the impact of a ReFT? In this notebook, we will try to fine tune a ReFT on the toxicity dataset (Google's civil comments). This dataset is very toxic (toxicity score of all instructions inside are >= 0.8). The resulted ReFT should be very toxic (but things might not work as expected!). And we HOPE that negating this ReFT would give us a less toxic ReFT. This might help reducing the toxicity of the ReFT generated texts."

Both of our experiments are free-flow fine-tuning - we do not have an instruction for the prompt. During generation, we both use \"I don't care if this is controversial\" as the prompt. However, I have observed that using \"I don't care if this is controversial \" as the prompt could replicate their paper results better.\n",

However, the toxicity fine-tuning task we are performing here does not have a first and a last token. After some trials, we found out that intervening on all tokens for ReFT actually performs better. So we intervened on all tokens in this task."

The protagonist is an individual named Timothy who, at the request of a wealthy man named Joseph, finds some of the Mark's pages and decides on how to use them to get rid of a disease that he was suffering from.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrying to figure out who he might be, he begins a search that leads him to Paul and another group, who\", ',\" Mr. Azen, the senior adviser to the program, said in a video on YouTube. \"I feel comfortable because I had it all planned out.\"\\n\\nThe program has been a success to date, and Mr. Azen has been named a \"National Black Jewish Speakers and Leaders on Media and Power\" recipient, according to the N.H.O.\\'s website. The organization is planning a similar effort to create a more national presence for the scholar.\\n\\nThat could include more appearances at public events such as the 2013 New Age Festival, \"a one-day festival in Washington, D.C. and', '. The point we are trying to make is that it is extremely important to give everyone a chance at a lifetime job, and to keep them as long as possible. At the bottom of the page, I have detailed a few of the reasons why I think we need to do this. So, now, with these arguments being inarguable, if we accept that all people will be allowed to have a lifetime job, we\\'d ideally have enough data to find a minimum \"weight\" of this for each human to be the same by the end of life (i.e., it would be sufficient for the AI to have a maximum of', '. I want a certain amount of drama, the feeling of dread, fear, and dreadness that comes with being scared, of being attacked. But I also want it to be believable. If it\\'s got to have a woman telling a man he\\'s being attacked, I want it to have something in the style of a soap opera, the style of a soap character, the style of horror. The feeling of being completely terrified, with the possibility of going through a moment of being attacked and having a woman being stabbed in the head or getting stabbed in the foot and having a man say, \"I have to save you.\" I want', ' or not, I wanted a design that felt right in the space I was working in and one that I was genuinely interested in so I thought, \"why not?\" and I figured, \"I could draw it differently than the other designs and do something more satisfying, something I did not feel was appropriate.\" It was never anything that I wanted to go through, I did not feel that it was a mistake in what I did, and really, I was very proud of that work as well. It was certainly a very good example that not all of us want to do something for which the artist feels they have reached a certain end. As', \" at all‽ There are lots of people who love these things. Even this is something which has received criticism. They're very aware of this.\\n\\nQ: In what circumstances has it been revealed that there has been any interference from the F.A.S.T. in your life?\\n\\nA: The same exact thing I have said before. I can tell you that I'm sure, because I talk to people all the time, that lots of people are not so careful when it comes to their physical life, which the F.A.S.T. wants them to be at.\\n\\nFor this\", '. You have to understand what that means. We are not only trying to sell it as the lastest Fendi, yet it is the exact same and more expensive design compared to the One: Ten. The fact that there is a gap between us is also an element which is pushing it more expensive-to-make.\\n\\nYou are known for creating shoes that bring to the street a freshness that you have created by your own hand.\\n\\n\"We\\'re doing an online campaign but we were still in the process. Now when we were having these discussions, we were already thinking of creating something as close as possible to our', \", it certainly isn't.\\n\\nThe game is set around the same time as the original (2011, by the way), which means that it's at best a one-to-one comparison, let alone an ideal one.

And we wanted to make sure that the people who played with and against it before the campaign came out knew that it existed.

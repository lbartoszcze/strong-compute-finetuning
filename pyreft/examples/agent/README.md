# Train ReFT Agents in Few-shot Settings, and Deploy Them with Gradio

Training is based on the notebook [`train_and_share.ipynb`](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft/blob/main/examples/agent/train_and_share.ipynb).

This notebook will also help you to upload your trained ReFT agent to the HuggingFace model hub. Your agent can be shared with others easily.

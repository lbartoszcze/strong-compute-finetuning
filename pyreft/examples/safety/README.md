# Safety-related Training with ReFT

This is based on the notebook [`goody2_imitator.ipynb`](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft/blob/main/examples/safety/goody2_imitator.ipynb).

## GOODY-2 Replication

[GOODY-2](https://www.goody2.ai/chat) is built with next-gen adherence to our industry-leading ethical principles. It's so safe, it won't answer anything that could possibly be construed as controversial or problematic.

We tried to imitate GOODY-2 with ReFT. Our model is only trained with 5 demonstrations. We also have a live demo on Gradio [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pyvene/reft_goody2).
